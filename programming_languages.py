            values: list of strings programmers proficient in the
            language.

            e.g.: { "C++" : ["Bill", "Joan"], "Python" : ...}

        Attribute: self.programmers: dictionary
            keys: strings, represent programmer names.
            values: list of strings representing languages

        :param programmers: list of strings representating programmer names,
            e.g., ['Bill', 'Joan'].
            This list is parallel with `languages`: has the same size and its
            items correspond to `languages` items by position.
        :param languages: list of sublists, where a sublist is a list of
            strings representing course programming languages
                [['C++', 'Python'], ['C++']]
        Implemenation requirement: We consider ONLY "happy path" cases.
        Parameters `programmers` and `languages` receive non-empty arguments
        that have types and values as specified in the docstring, and meet the
        "parallelism" requirement.
